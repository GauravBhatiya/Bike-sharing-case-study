# Bike Sharing Analysis
This project provides an in-depth analysis of bike-sharing data to understand user behavior, trip patterns, and operational metrics. The insights derived can help bike-sharing services optimize their operations, improve user experience, and make data-driven decisions.


## **Motivation**
Bike-sharing systems have become a popular mode of transportation in urban areas. Understanding user behavior and trip trends is critical for:
- Enhancing fleet management.
- Improving customer satisfaction.
- Increasing operational efficiency.

This project aims to uncover key insights from bike-sharing data, focusing on differences between **casual users** and **members**, as well as trip patterns over time.


## **Key Insights**
### **1. User Comparison**
- **Casual Users vs. Members:**
  - Casual users have longer mean trip durations (21.9 mins) compared to members (12.1 mins).
  - Casual users primarily ride on weekends, whereas members ride more evenly throughout the week.

- **Types of Bicycles Used:**
  - Members prefer electric bikes (42.57%) and classic bikes (22.54%).
  - Casual users also favor classic bikes but use docked bikes (1.50%) the least.

### **2. Temporal Trends**
- **Daily Patterns:**
  - Member trips peak during weekdays, especially during commuting hours.
  - Casual trips dominate weekends.

- **Yearly Trends:**
  - Trips increase during warmer months (May to August), with July having the highest activity.
  - Trips are lowest during winter months (January and February).

### **3. Operational Metrics**
- **Mean Distance:** Casual users travel slightly longer distances (2.40 km) compared to members (2.36 km).
- **Trip Count:** Over 49.45 million trips recorded in the dataset.


## **Data and Tools**
### **Data Sources**
1. **Trip Data:** Contains details about trip duration, start/end times, user type (casual or member), and bicycle type.
2. **External Data:** Weather and temporal data to contextualize trip trends.

### **Tools Used**
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook):** For data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Power BI:** To create dashboards and visual representations of key metrics.

## **Methodology**
### **1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values and standardized formats for dates and times.
- Merged trip data with external data sources for richer analysis.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed user behavior patterns based on trip duration, time of day, and day of the week.
- Visualized trends using Python libraries and Power BI dashboards.

### **3. Dashboard Creation**
- Created interactive visualizations in Power BI to:
  - Compare casual users and members.
  - Analyze trip distribution by time, day, and season.


## **Results and Recommendations**
### **1. Insights for Operational Efficiency**
- Focus on bike availability during weekends to cater to casual users.
- Optimize fleet distribution during peak weekday commuting hours for members.

### **2. User Engagement Strategies**
- Introduce promotions for casual users to convert them into members.
- Provide incentives for members during off-peak hours.

### **3. Seasonal Adjustments**
- Increase fleet size and maintenance efforts during summer months to handle demand.
- Offer discounts or alternative services during winter to sustain usage.


## **Future Work**
1. **Incorporate Weather Data:**
   - Analyze the impact of weather conditions on trip patterns.
2. **Predictive Analysis:**
   - Build models to forecast demand based on historical and external data.
3. **Expand Geographical Analysis:**
   - Examine patterns across different regions or cities.
